NOTES FROM
The Gay Science
Friedrich Nietzsche
April 28, 2024
Translator’s Introduction

Finally, it is no accident that the homosexuals as well as Nietzsche opted for “gay” rather than “cheerful.” “Gay science,” unlike “cheerful science,” has overtones of a light-hearted defiance of convention; it suggests Nietzsche’s “immoralism” and his “revaluation of values.”

April 28, 2024
Translator’s Introduction

What Nietzsche himself wanted the title to convey was that serious thinking does not have to be stodgy, heavy, dusty, or, in one word, Teutonic.

Never have I felt so much at home in a book, and in my home, as—I may not praise it, it is too close to me

the eternal recurrence of the same events at immense intervals

April 29, 2024
Translator’s Introduction

I do not want life again. How did I endure it? Creating. What makes me stand the sight of it? The vision of the overman who affirms life. I have tried to affirm it myself—alas!

April 29, 2024
Translator’s Introduction

His reflections on women, on the other hand, generally have little merit and originality. They show the influence of La Rochefoucauld, Chamfort, and Schopenhauer, without equaling in either venom or absurdity Schopenhauer’s famous diatribe “On Women.” In sum, they are on the whole strikingly inferior to the rest of his work.

Nietzsche’s Preface for the Second Edition

“Incipit tragoedia” we read at the end of this awesomely aweless book. Beware! Something downright wicked and malicious is announced here: incipit parodia, no doubt.

April 30, 2024
Nietzsche’s Preface for the Second Edition

But in the former case, which is more common, when it is distress that philosophizes, as is the case with all sick thinkers—and perhaps sick thinkers are more numerous in the history of philosophy—what will become of the thought itself when it is subjected to the pressure of sickness?

April 30, 2024
Nietzsche’s Preface for the Second Edition

For a psychologist there are few questions that are as attractive as that concerning the relation of health and philosophy, and if he should himself become ill, he will bring all of his scientific curiosity into his illness.

April 30, 2024
Nietzsche’s Preface for the Second Edition

often I have asked myself whether, taking a large view, philosophy has not been merely an interpretation of the body and a misunderstanding of the body.

April 30, 2024
Nietzsche’s Preface for the Second Edition

All those bold insanities of metaphysics, especially answers to the question about the value of existence, may always be considered first of all as the symptoms of certain bodies. And if such world affirmations or world negations tout court lack any grain of significance when measured scientifically, they are the more valuable for the historian and psychologist as hints or symptoms of the body, of its success or failure, its plenitude, power, and autocracy in history, or of its frustrations, weariness, impoverishment, its premonitions of the end, its will to the end.

April 30, 2024
Nietzsche’s Preface for the Second Edition

Only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit, being the teacher of the great suspicion that turns every U into an X, a real, genuine X, that is the letter before the penultimate one.

April 30, 2024
Nietzsche’s Preface for the Second Edition

I doubt that such pain makes us “better”; but I know that it makes us more profound.

April 30, 2024
Nietzsche’s Preface for the Second Edition

The trust in life is gone: life itself has become a problem.

April 30, 2024
Nietzsche’s Preface for the Second Edition

In the end, lest what is most important remain unsaid: from such abysses, from such severe sickness, also from the sickness of severe suspicion, one returns newborn, having shed one’s skin, more ticklish and malicious, with a more delicate taste for joy, with a tenderer tongue for all good things, with merrier senses, with a second dangerous innocence in joy, more childlike and yet a hundred times subtler than one has ever been before.

“Joke, Cunning, and Revenge”: Prelude in German Rhymes

“True to nature, all the truth: that’s art.” This hallowed notion is a threadbare fable.

“Joke, Cunning, and Revenge”: Prelude in German Rhymes

Half of your life is done, And it was pain and error through and through: Why do you still seek on? Precisely this I seek: The reason why!

1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

All of us harbor concealed gardens and plantings; and, to use another metaphor, we are, all of us, growing volcanoes that approach the hour of their eruption; but how near or distant that is, nobody knows—not even God.

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

It is easier to cope with a bad conscience than to cope with a bad reputation.

May 3, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

I no longer know whether you, my dear fellow man and neighbor, are at all capable of living in a way that would damage the species; in other words, “unreasonably” and “badly.” What might have harmed the species may have become extinct many thousands of years ago and may by now be one of those things that are not possible even for God. Pursue your best or your worst desires, and above all perish! In both cases you are probably still in some way a promoter and benefactor of humanity and therefore entitled to your eulogists—but also to your detractors. But you will never find anyone who could wholly mock you as an individual, also in your best qualities, bringing home to you to the limits of truth your boundless, flylike, froglike wretchedness!

May 3, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

For the present, the comedy of existence has not yet “become conscious” of itself. For the present, we still live in the age of tragedy, the age of moralities and religions.

May 3, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Gradually, man has become a fantastic animal that has to fulfill one more condition of existence than any other animal: man has to believe, to know, from time to time why he exists; his race cannot flourish without a periodic trust in life—without faith in reason in life.

May 3, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

And again and again the human race will decree from time to time: “There is something at which it is absolutely forbidden henceforth to laugh.”

May 3, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

I keep having the same experience and keep resisting it every time. I do not want to believe it although it is palpable: the great majority of people lacks an intellectual conscience. Indeed, it has often seemed to me as if anyone calling for an intellectual conscience were as lonely in the most densely populated cities as if he were in a desert. Everybody looks at you with strange eyes and goes right on handling his scales, calling this good and that evil. Nobody even blushes when you intimate that their weights are underweight; nor do people feel outraged; they merely laugh at your doubts.

May 3, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Among some pious people I found a hatred of reason and was well disposed to them for that; for this at least betrayed their bad intellectual conscience. But to stand in the midst of this rerum concordia discors2 and of this whole marvelous uncertainty and rich ambiguity of existence without questioning, without trembling with the craving and the rapture of such questioning, without at least hating the person who questions, perhaps even finding him faintly amusing—that is what I feel to be contemptible, and this is the feeling for which I look first in everybody.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Common natures consider all noble, magnanimous feelings inexpedient and therefore first of all incredible.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

But when such exceptional people do not see themselves as the exception, how can they ever understand the common type and arrive at a fair evaluation of the rule? Thus they, too, speak of the folly, inexpediency, and fantasies of humanity, stunned that the course of the world should be so insane, and puzzled that it won’t own up to what “is needful.”—This is the eternal injustice of those who are noble.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

all ordered society puts the passions to sleep

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Refined servility clings to the categorical imperative and is the mortal enemy of those who wish to deprive duty of its unconditional character; that is what decency demands of them, and not only decency.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Our visible moral qualities, and especially those we believe to be visible, follow their own course; and the invisible ones that have the same names but are in relation to other men neither ornaments nor weapons, also follow their own course—probably, a wholly different course; and they probably have lines, subtleties, and sculptures that might give pleasure to a god with a divine microscope.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Before a function is fully developed and mature it constitutes a danger for the organism, and it is good if during the interval it is subjected to some tyranny. Thus consciousness is tyrannized—not least by our pride in it.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

But what if pleasure and displeasure were so tied together that whoever wanted to have as much as possible of one must also have as much as possible of the other—that whoever wanted to learn to “jubilate up to the heavens” would also have to be prepared for “depression unto death”?

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

—or as much displeasure as possible as the price for the growth of an abundance of subtle pleasures and joys that have rarely been relished yet.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Benefiting and hurting others are ways of exercising one’s power upon others; that is all one desires in such cases.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

One hurts those whom one wants to feel one’s power, for pain is a much more efficient means to that end than pleasure; pain always raises the question about its origin while pleasure is inclined to stop with itself without looking back.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Those who feel “I possess Truth”—how many possessions would they not abandon in order to save this feeling! What would they not throw overboard to stay “on top”—which means, above the others who lack “the Truth”!

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

What is decisive is how one is accustomed to spice one’s life: it is a matter of taste whether one prefers the slow or the sudden, the assured or the dangerous and audacious increase of power; one seeks this or that spice depending on one’s temperament.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Certainly the state in which we hurt others is rarely as agreeable, in an unadulterated way, as that in which we benefit others; it is a sign that we are still lacking power, or it shows a sense of frustration in the face of this poverty;

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

An easy prey is something contemptible for proud natures. They feel good only at the sight of unbroken men who might become their enemies and at the sight of all possessions that are hard to come by.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Pity is praised as the virtue of prostitutes.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Our love of our neighbor—is it not a lust for new possessions?

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Avarice and love: what different feelings these two terms evoke!

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Our pleasure in ourselves tries to maintain itself by again and again changing something new into ourselves; that is what possession means.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

When we see somebody suffer, we like to exploit this opportunity to take possession of him; those who become his benefactors and pity him, for example, do this and call the lust for a new possession that he awakens in them “love”; and the pleasure they feel is comparable to that aroused by the prospect of a new conquest.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

If one considers that this means nothing less than excluding the whole world from a precious good, from happiness and enjoyment; if one considers that the lover aims at the impoverishment and deprivation of all competitors and would like to become the dragon guarding his golden hoard as the most inconsiderate and selfish of all “conquerors” and exploiters; if one considers, finally, that to the lover himself the whole rest of the world appears indifferent, pale, and worthless, and he is prepared to make any sacrifice, to disturb any order, to subordinate all other interests—then one comes to feel genuine amazement that this wild avarice and injustice of sexual love has been glorified and deified so much in all ages—indeed, that this love has furnished the concept of love as the opposite of egoism while it actually may be the most ingenuous expression of egoism.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

At this point linguistic usage has evidently been formed by those who did not possess but desired. Probably, there have always been too many of these. Those to whom much possession and satiety were granted in this area have occasionally made some casual remark about “the raging demon,” as that most gracious and beloved of all Athenians, Sophocles, did; but Eros has always laughed at such blasphemers; they were invariably his greatest favorites.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

a shared higher thirst for an ideal above them. But who knows such love? Who has experienced it? Its right name is friendship.

May 5, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Perhaps you know some people near you who must look at themselves only from a distance in order to find themselves at all tolerable or attractive and invigorating. Self-knowledge is strictly inadvisable for them.

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

But when you now think of that little footbridge, words fail you and you sob and marvel.

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

When you have a virtue, a real, whole virtue (and not merely a mini-instinct for some virtue), you are its victim.

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Thus one feels sorry for the youth not for his own sake but because a devoted instrument, ruthless against itself—a so-called “good man”—has been lost to society by his death.

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

That is how education always proceeds: one tries to condition an individual by various attractions and advantages to adopt a way of thinking and behaving that, once it has become a habit, instinct, and passion, will dominate him to his own ultimate disadvantage but “for the general good.”

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

The most industrious of all ages—ours—does not know how to make anything of all its industriousness and money, except always still more money and still more industriousness; for it requires more genius to spend than to acquire.

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Life—that is: continually shedding something that wants to die.

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Thus we become hard against everything in us that desires consideration, and our greatness is also our lack of compassion.

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

one lied, mendaciously inventing reasons for these laws, simply to avoid admitting that one had become used to these laws and no longer wanted things to be different.

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Thus the surroundings and exteriors of famous men die continually, even while everybody seems to be pushing to get near them and lend them his own character: in this they resemble great cities.

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

What attracts them is the sight of the zeal that surrounds a cause—as it were, the sight of the burning fuse, and not the cause itself.

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

For at bottom the masses are willing to submit to slavery of any kind, if only the higher-ups constantly legitimize themselves as higher, as born to command—by having noble manners.

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

For thinkers and all sensitive spirits, boredom is that disagreeable “windless calm” of the soul that precedes a happy voyage and cheerful winds. They have to bear it and must wait for its effect on them.

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

The laws do not betray what a people are but rather what seems to them foreign, strange, uncanny, outlandish.

May 6, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

Magnanimity contains the same degree of egoism as does revenge, but egoism of a different quality.

May 7, 2024
1. The teachers of the purpose of existence,

These young people demand that—not happiness but unhappiness should approach from the outside and become visible; and their imagination is busy in advance to turn it into a monster so that afterward they can fight a monster.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

And what is “reality” for an artist in love?

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

Your sobriety still contains a secret and inextinguishable drunkenness.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

“The human being under the skin” is for all lovers a horror and unthinkable, a blasphemy against God and love.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

“But is it not crueler to let it live?” asked the holy man.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

And man’s greatest labor so far has been to reach agreement about very many things and to submit to a law of agreement—regardless of whether these things are true or false.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

The greatest danger that always hovered over humanity and still hovers over it is the eruption of madness—which means the eruption of arbitrariness in feeling, seeing, and hearing, the enjoyment of the mind’s lack of discipline, the joy in human unreason.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

It is in these impatient spirits that a veritable delight in madness erupts because madness has such a cheerful tempo.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

Without this art we would be nothing but foreground and live entirely in the spell of that perspective which makes what is closest at hand and most vulgar appear as if it were vast, and reality itself.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

Perhaps one should concede a similar merit to the religion that made men see the sinfulness of every single individual through a magnifying glass, turning the sinner into a great, immortal criminal. By surrounding him with eternal perspectives, it taught man to see himself from a distance and as something past and whole.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

The Greeks (or at least the Athenians) liked to hear people speak well. Nothing distinguishes them so thoroughly from non-Greeks as does this truly greedy craving.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

This kind of deviation from nature is perhaps the most agreeable repast for human pride: for its sake man loves art as the expression of a lofty, heroic unnaturalness and convention.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

“Should we not make new for ourselves what is old and find ourselves in it? Should we not have the right to breathe our own soul into this dead body? For it is dead after all; how ugly is everything dead!”

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

Thus one tried to compel the gods by using rhythm and to force their hand: poetry was thrown at them like a magical snare.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

Whoever finds enough tragedy and comedy in himself, probably does best when he stays away from the theater.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

And does not everything that we take seriously betray us? It always shows what has weight for us and what does not.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

I am annoyed by and ashamed of my writing; writing is for me a pressing and embarrassing need, and to speak of it even in a parable disgusts me.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

B: But why, then, do you write? —A: Well, my friend, to be quite frank: so far, I have not discovered any other way of getting rid of my thoughts. —B: And why do you want to get rid of them? —A: Why I want to? Do I want to? I must. —B: Enough! Enough!

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

What is all of Hamlet’s melancholy compared to that of Brutus? And perhaps Shakespeare knew both from firsthand experience. Perhaps he, too, had his gloomy hour and his evil angel, like Brutus.

May 7, 2024
57. To the realists,

For here his cleanliness was quite unprecedented among German philosophers, and he lived and died “as a Voltairian.”

May 8, 2024
57. To the realists,

Now that every court has become a caricature of the past and present, one is amazed to find even Voltaire incredibly prim and fastidious at this point (for example, in his judgments about such stylists as Fontenelle and Montesquieu). For all of us are now emancipated from courtly taste, while Voltaire perfected it.

May 9, 2024
57. To the realists,

If we had not welcomed the arts and invented this kind of cult of the untrue, then the realization of general untruth and mendaciousness that now comes to us through science—the realization that delusion and error are conditions of human knowledge and sensation—would be utterly unbearable. Honesty would lead to nausea and suicide.

May 9, 2024
57. To the realists,

As an aesthetic phenomenon existence is still bearable for us

May 9, 2024
57. To the realists,

At times we need a rest from ourselves by looking upon, by looking down upon, ourselves and, from an artistic distance, laughing over ourselves or weeping over ourselves.

May 9, 2024
57. To the realists,

it is only as an aesthetic phenomenon that existence and the world are eternally justified

What religion wants from the masses is no more than that they should keep still with their eyes, hands, legs, and other organs; that way they become more beautiful for a while and—look more like human beings.

Only martyrdom and the ascetic’s slow destruction of his body were permitted.

The living is merely a type of what is dead, and a very rare type.

Book Three

Thus the strength of knowledge does not depend on its degree of truth but on its age, on the degree to which it has been incorporated, on its character as a condition of life.

May 11, 2024
Book Three

At bottom, every high degree of caution in making inferences and every skeptical tendency constitute a great danger for life. No living beings would have survived if the opposite tendency—to affirm rather than suspend judgment, to err and make up things rather than wait, to assent rather than negate, to pass judgment rather than be just—had not been bred to the point where it became extraordinarily strong.

May 12, 2024
Book Three

Oh, the poor bird that felt free and now strikes the walls of this cage! Woe, when you feel homesick for the land as if it had offered more freedom—and there is no longer any “land.”

May 12, 2024
Book Three

Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.

Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?

Misanthropy comes of an all too greedy love of man and “cannibalism”; but who asked you to swallow men like oysters, Prince Hamlet?

May 13, 2024
Book Three

Animals as critics.— I fear that the animals consider man as a being like themselves that has lost in a most dangerous way its sound animal common sense; they consider him the insane animal, the laughing animal, the weeping animal, the miserable animal.

May 14, 2024
Book Three

As long as Prometheus feels pity for men and sacrifices himself for them, he is happy and great; but when he becomes envious of Zeus and the homage paid to him by mortals, then he suffers.

Book Four: Sanctus Januarius

Hasn’t the time come to say of morality what Master Eckhart said: “I ask God to rid me of God.”

May 14, 2024
Book Four: Sanctus Januarius

Yes, at the very bottom of my soul I feel grateful to all my misery and bouts of sickness and everything about me that is imperfect, because this sort of thing leaves me with a hundred backdoors through which I can escape from enduring habits.

May 14, 2024
Book Four: Sanctus Januarius

Most intolerable, to be sure, and the terrible par excellence would be for me a life entirely devoid of habits, a life that would demand perpetual improvisation. That would be my exile and my Siberia.

infinitely more had to be promised than could ever be fulfilled in order that anything at all might be fulfilled in the realm of knowledge.

We are neither as proud nor as happy as we might be.

Book Four: Sanctus Januarius

Do you suppose that he feels unhappy about that? He made up his mind long ago not to take his own desires and plans too seriously. “If I do not succeed at this,” he says to himself, “I may perhaps succeed at that; and on the whole I do not know whether I do not have more reason to be grateful to my failures than to any success.

May 14, 2024
Book Four: Sanctus Januarius

Was I made to be stubborn and to have horns like a bull? What constitutes the value and result of life for me lies elsewhere; my pride as well as my misery lie elsewhere. I know more about life because I have so often been on the verge of losing it; and precisely for that reason I get more out of life than any of you.

May 14, 2024
Book Four: Sanctus Januarius

For one must be able to lose oneself occasionally if one wants to learn something from things different from oneself.

May 14, 2024

What killed that opinion for you was your new life and not your reason: you no longer need it, and now it collapses and unreason crawls out of it into the light like a worm.

May 14, 2024
Book Four: Sanctus Januarius

Everything suits me, for everything suits you so well, and I am so well-disposed toward you for everything; how could I think of betraying you?

Or finally: will I blow myself out lest I burn out?

May 14, 2024
Book Four: Sanctus Januarius

The true pathos of every period of our life rarely becomes clear to us as long as we live in this period; then we always assume that it is the only state that is possible and reasonable for us and—to speak with the Greeks and adopt their distinction—an ethos and not a pathos.

May 17, 2024
Book Four: Sanctus Januarius

What fantasies about the inner “misery” of evil people moral preachers have invented! What lies they have told us about the unhappiness of passionate people!

May 17, 2024
Book Four: Sanctus Januarius

Whether it was death or the poison or piety or malice—something loosened his tongue at that moment and he said: “O Crito, I owe Asclepius a rooster.” This ridiculous and terrible “last word” means for those who have ears: “O Crito, life is a disease.” Is it possible that a man like him, who had lived cheerfully and like a soldier in the sight of everyone, should have been a pessimist? He had merely kept a cheerful mien while concealing all his life long his ultimate judgment, his inmost feeling. Socrates, Socrates suffered life! And then he still revenged himself—with this veiled, gruesome, pious, and blasphemous saying. Did a Socrates need such revenge? Did his overrich virtue lack an ounce of magnanimity? —Alas, my friends, we must overcome even the Greeks!

May 17, 2024
Book Four: Sanctus Januarius

The question in each and every thing, “Do you desire this once more and innumerable times more?” would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight. Or how well disposed would you have to become to yourself and to life to crave nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and seal?

May 18, 2024
Book Five: We Fearless Ones

And a confidential question: Even the claim that they possessed wisdom, which has been made here and there on earth by philosophers, the maddest and most immodest of all claims—has it not always been to date, in India as well as in Greece, a screen above all? At times perhaps a screen chosen with pedagogical intent, which hallows so many lies; one has a tender regard for those still in the process of becoming, of growing—for disciples, who must often be defended against themselves by means of faith in a person (by means of an error). Much more often, however, it is a screen behind which the philosopher saves himself because he has become weary, old, cold, hard—as a premonition that the end is near, like the prudence animals have before they die: they go off by themselves, become still, choose solitude, hide in caves, and become wise.

I do not know of any more profound difference in the whole orientation of an artist than this, whether he looks at his work in progress (at “himself”) from the point of view of the witness, or whether he “has forgotten the world,” which is the essential feature of all monological art; it is based on forgetting, it is the music of forgetting.

Why is it then that I have never yet encountered anybody, not even in books, who approached morality in this personal way and who knew morality as a problem, and this problem as his own personal distress, torment, voluptuousness, and passion?

For man is a reverent animal. But he is also mistrustful; and that the world is not worth what we thought it was, that is about as certain as anything of which our mistrust has finally got hold. The more mistrust, the more philosophy.

For fanaticism is the only “strength of the will” that even the weak and insecure can be brought to attain, being a sort of hypnotism of the whole system of the senses and the intellect for the benefit of an excessive nourishment (hypertrophy) of a single point of view and feeling that henceforth becomes dominant—which the Christian calls his faith. Once a human being reaches the fundamental conviction that he must be commanded, he becomes “a believer.”

The wish to preserve oneself is the symptom of a condition of distress, of a limitation of the really fundamental instinct of life which aims at the expansion of power and, wishing for that, frequently risks and even sacrifices self-preservation.

Even genius does not compensate for such a deficiency, however much it may deceive people about it. This becomes clear to anyone who has ever watched our most gifted painters and musicians from nearby. All of them, with scarcely any exception, know how to use cunning inventions of manners, of makeshift devices, and even of principles to give themselves after the event an artificial semblance of such probity, of such solidity of training and culture—without, of course, managing to deceive themselves, without silencing for good their own bad conscience. For you surely know that all great modern artists suffer from a guilty conscience.

But there are two kinds of sufferers: first, those who suffer from the over-fullness of life—they want a Dionysian art and likewise a tragic view of life, a tragic insight—and then those who suffer from the impoverishment of life and seek rest, stillness, calm seas, redemptiom from themselves through art and knowledge, or intoxication, convulsions, anaesthesia, and madness.

Regarding all aesthetic values I now avail myself of this main distinction: I ask in every instance, “is it hunger or superabundance that has here become creative?”

But it can also be the tyrannic will of one who suffers deeply, who struggles, is tormented, and would like to turn what is most personal, singular, and narrow, the real idiosyncrasy of his suffering, into a binding law and compulsion—one who, as it were, revenges himself on all things by forcing his own image, the image of his torture, on them, branding them with it. This last version is romantic pessimism in its most expressive form, whether it be Schopenhauer’s philosophy of will or Wagner’s music—romantic pessimism, the last great event in the fate of our culture.
